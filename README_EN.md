### introduction

1.This is my second android application and also my graduate design. It accompleshed basic function of Android development such as getting information, post data, and account regist and login.

  

2.Because of my finite develop skill,and longtern expoilt time, the style of the codes may be have distinction. I'm tring to refactor the code and make it to be better.

  

3.This app is about China heritages which contains news, introduce of the heritages and user community.

  

4.when I developed the program,I controlled the using of the third party library because of the learning needs that I want to implement my app foundation without use a ripe framework, I think that could help me understand the Android development procedure.

  

5、 This application has 4 parts, which is the main page, folk page, find page and person page. The main page shows the news about China heritages. The folk mage introduces all of the heritage which is included in the China heritage list. The Find page seems like Instagram, I referenced the UI and UX of Instagram. The Person page can manage the account and theme setting.



6、Here is my application server [heritage-webservice](https://github.com/sunkaiiii/heritage_webservice )



7、The old versions server, older than v2.6.1, is in [heritage_webservice_old](https://github.com/sunkaiiii/heritage_webservice_old)


  
8、This app is firstly coding by Java, but after v2.0, using Kotlin to implement new functions, for now, this is a completely Kotlin project.
